# parkMe

### ideas

- map will show areas highlighted in green, yellow, or red. Green means that you can park there either free or for a fee. Red means that you may not park there without a sufficient pass or else you will be towed. Yellow means that someone has registered with the app to rent out their private parking for a fee. 

- Person who rents our personal parking space can look at what similar spots and locations are going for on the map and base their price off of that. 

- Possible names : Findtwolines : safepark.io : swiftpark

- Motto very simple and minimalistic : Making parking more accesible : Connecting people... : Bridging the gap
